**The Why**

It's the age old problem: you've been dating someone for a couple months and you collectively decide that it's time to go to a music festival. You pack your bags, head to Indio, thinking you were going to have a great time. But something weird happens once you get to Coachella: you and your significant other are ARGUING the entire time. You want to go to Kendrick Lamar and she wants to see Lana Del Rey. You're more of a Sahara tent person and she's more of a Gobi tent person. You leave the festival, and this relationship that you thought was awesome. You now realize "music taste really does matter." While this may or may not be a fictional account, the lesson is that music taste can be a deal breaker that needs to be weeded out in the early stages of a relationship.

**Solution** 

A dating app, or website, that only displays a users music preference. 

✅  Connect with Spotify API to create user profiles based off of listening preferences

✅  Matches you with other users who have previously "liked" your profile
