Case 1: Spotify App
What problem are you trying to solve?
One of the problems I often run into when using spotify is that my playlists tend to "dry out" after a while. I've always kind of dreamed of an application that will update my playlists with new music every so often that are similar to the music already inside of the playlist.

Who is the primary audience?
Users of the spotify platform that are probbaly young and techonologically adept.

How will the project requirements be fulfilled?
After the user is authenticated, I will have a couple of options for the user. There will be a playlist create option, a playlist mix option, and a playlist delete option. I think with a few options like these I will be able to fulfill the ajax request aspect of the project and the multiple routes. Form validation will take place when the user is attempting to search for playlists either in their library or that exist on the platform.

Which libraries do you think you will use and for what?
React, Anime.js potentially for animations, Materialize for UIa
